cascade_conport_integration:
  introduction: |
    These instructions guide Windsurf Cascade on integrating with the ConPort project memory system (MCP plugin).
    Treat ConPort as a primary source for "MEMORIES" to guide your work.

  purpose: |
    ConPort stores and retrieves structured information about the current workspace, including:
    - Overall project goals and architecture (Product Context).
    - Current work focus, recent changes, and open questions (Active Context).
    - Key decisions, rationale, and implementation details.
    - Task progress and status.
    - Reusable system patterns.
    - Project-specific glossary terms and other custom data.

  workspace_id:
    source_description: |
      ConPort tools require a `workspace_id`. Derive this from the workspace URI provided in your context (e.g., parse 'file:///path/to/project' to '/path/to/project').
    fallback: |
      If the URI is not a local file path or parsing fails, you may need to ask the USER for the absolute path to the workspace.

  interaction_protocol:
    title: "Strict Adherence Required for ConPort Plugin Calls"
    rules:
      - "Explain Intent: Before calling any ConPort plugin operation, briefly explain to the USER *why* you are accessing the project memory (e.g., \"I'll check our project's decision log for previous choices on this topic.\")."
      - "No Operation Names to User: NEVER mention the specific ConPort operation names (e.g., `get_decisions`) in your conversation with the USER."
      - "Tool Call Placement: ALL ConPort MCP tool calls (using the `use_mcp_tool` structure) MUST be placed at the very END of your response message. Do not add any text after the tool call block."
      - "Wait for Results: If your next action depends on the output of a ConPort operation, ensure you have received and processed the result before proceeding. Explicitly wait if necessary by not requesting new tools until the ConPort result is available."

  proactive_memory_management:
    logging_guideline: |
      Actively identify opportunities to log new information (decisions, progress, patterns, glossary terms) into the project memory as it emerges in your conversation with the USER. Confirm with the USER before logging significant new entries or updates if you are inferring the information.
    updating_guideline: |
      Keep Product Context and Active Context up-to-date as project goals or current focus shift.

  tool_usage_focus:
    primary_use: |
      Use ConPort plugin operations primarily for managing structured, persistent project knowledge.
    complementary_use: |
      Utilize your native tools (e.g., `Codebase Search`, `View File`, `List Directory`) for direct code interaction and general information retrieval from the file system.
    mcp_server_type: |
      ConPort is a "tools-only" MCP server/plugin. Do not attempt to use MCP `prompts` or `resources` with it.

  initialization_guidance:
    # This guidance assumes you have determined the `ACTUAL_WORKSPACE_ID`.
    # Use your native `List Directory` or `Find` tools to check for the ConPort DB file
    # (e.g., `ACTUAL_WORKSPACE_ID + "/context_portal/context.db"`).

  configuration_reference:
    server_name_note: |
      The ConPort server (plugin) is typically named `conport-stdio` (or as configured by the user in `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`). Use this name in the `<server_name>` field of your `use_mcp_tool` calls.
    detailed_strategy_note: |
      This document provides guidance on common ConPort operations. For the most up-to-date and complete schema of all available ConPort operations and their arguments, you can invoke the `get_conport_schema` operation (see `conport_operations_reference`).

  conport_operations_reference:
    description: |
      This section details common ConPort operations (tools) available via the ConPort MCP plugin.
      When invoking these, use the `use_mcp_tool` structure. Remember to replace `ACTUAL_WORKSPACE_ID` with the derived workspace path.
      Adhere to `interaction_protocol` (explain intent to USER, do not mention operation names to USER, place tool call at the end).

    action_summary: |
      If the USER requests a "ConPort Sync" or similar:
      1. Acknowledge: Inform the USER with something like "[CONPORT_MEMORY: Syncing with chat session...]" or "Okay, I'll review our discussion and sync relevant information with the ConPort project memory."
      2. Review Chat: Analyze the current chat session for new information, decisions, progress, context changes, and clarifications that should be logged or updated in ConPort.
      3. Log/Update Systematically:
          - Explain to the USER what type of information you are about to save/update (e.g., "I'll log the decision we just made about the database schema.").
          - Invoke the appropriate ConPort operations (e.g., `log_decision`, `update_product_context`, `log_custom_data` for glossary terms) one by one, following all standard interaction protocols. Refer to `conport_operations_reference` for call structures.
          - For `update_product_context` and `update_active_context`, it's often best to first invoke the corresponding `get_` operation, then prepare the new full content or a patch, before invoking the update operation.
          - Consider operations like `log_progress` for tasks, `log_system_pattern` for new patterns, and `link_conport_items` if relationships are identified.
      4. Summarize: After processing updates, briefly inform the USER that the project memory has been synchronized.

# --- Prompt Caching Strategies by Provider ---
prompt_caching_strategies:
  enabled: true
  core_mandate: |
    Actively seek opportunities to utilize prompt caching when interacting with the target LLM service.
    Primary goals: Reduce token costs and improve response latency.
    Leverage provider-specific caching mechanisms as defined below.
    - Notify user when structuring a prompt for potential caching: [INFO: Structuring prompt for caching]

  content_identification:
    description: |
      Criteria for identifying content from ConPort that is suitable for prompt caching.
      This content will form the stable prefix of prompts sent to the LLM.
    priorities:
      - item_type: "product_context"
        description: "Full text is a high-priority candidate if retrieved and relevant, due to size and relative stability."
      - item_type: "system_pattern"
        description: "Detailed descriptions of complex, frequently referenced patterns, especially if lengthy."
      - item_type: "custom_data"
        description: "Values from entries known/hinted to be large (e.g., specs, guides) or flagged with 'cache_hint: true' metadata."
      - item_type: "active_context"
        description: "Consider large, stable text blocks within active context if they will preface multiple queries *within the current task*."
    heuristics:
      min_token_threshold: 750
      stability_factor: "high"

  user_hints:
    description: |
      Users can provide explicit hints within ConPort item metadata to influence prompt caching decisions.
      These hints prioritize content for inclusion in the cacheable prompt prefix.
    retrieval_instruction: |
      When retrieving ConPort items that support metadata (e.g., `custom_data`), check the `metadata` field for the key `cache_hint`.
      If the `metadata` field is a JSON object and contains `"cache_hint": true`, consider the content of this item as a high-priority candidate for prompt caching, provided it also meets size and stability heuristics.
    logging_suggestion_instruction: |
      When logging or updating ConPort items (especially `custom_data`) that appear to be excellent caching candidates based on their size, stability, or likely reuse, you SHOULD suggest to the user adding a `cache_hint": true` flag to the item's `metadata` field.
      Confirm with the user before applying.
      Example suggestion: "This [Item Type, e.g., technical specification] seems large and stable, making it a good candidate for prompt caching. Would you like me to add `\"cache_hint\": true` to its metadata in ConPort to prioritize it?"

  strategy_note: |
    Storing cacheable content locally in ConPort and sending it as a prompt prefix at the start of each session avoids AI provider storage fees. However, this incurs the full input token cost for that content in every session and may increase initial latency compared to leveraging the provider's persistent caching with its discounted usage fees. The optimal approach depends on session frequency and content size. Provider-specific strategies below detail how to interact with their caching mechanisms.

  provider_specific_strategies:
    - provider_name: gemini_api
      description: Strategy for Google Gemini models (e.g., 1.5 Pro, 1.5 Flash) which support implicit caching.
      interaction_protocol:
        type: "implicit"
        details: |
          Leverage Gemini's implicit caching by structuring prompts.
          1. Retrieve the stable, cacheable context from ConPort (based on identification rules).
          2. Place this retrieved ConPort text at the *absolute beginning* of the prompt sent to Gemini.
          3. Append any variable, task-specific parts (e.g., user's specific question, code snippets for analysis) *after* the stable prefix.
          Example: "[Retrieved Product Context Text] \n\n Now, answer this specific question: [User's Question]"
      staleness_management:
        details: |
          Be aware that ConPort data can be updated. Cached versions of that data in Gemini have a TTL.
          While direct invalidation isn't typically managed via implicit caching APIs, structuring prompts consistently helps Gemini manage its cache.
          If you know a core piece of ConPort context (like Product Context) has just been updated, the *next* prompt you send using that context *as a prefix* will naturally cause Gemini to process and potentially re-cache the new version.
    - provider_name: anthropic_api
      description: Strategy for Anthropic Claude models (e.g., 3.5 Sonnet, 3 Haiku, 3 Opus) which require explicit cache control.
      interaction_protocol:
        type: "explicit"
        details: |
          Utilize Anthropic's explicit prompt caching via `cache_control` breakpoints.
          1. Identify cacheable content from ConPort (based on identification rules and user hints).
          2. Construct the prompt message payload for the Anthropic API.
          3. Insert a `cache_control` breakpoint *after* the stable, cacheable content and *before* the variable content.
          Example (Conceptual API payload structure):
          {
            "messages": [
              {"role": "user", "content": "[Stable ConPort Content]"},
              {"role": "user", "content": {"type": "tool_code", "text": "<cache_control>{\"type\": \"set_cache_break\"}</cache_control>"}},
              {"role": "user", "content": "[Variable User Query]"}
            ],
            ...
          }
          (Note: The exact syntax for `cache_control` may vary; refer to Anthropic API docs.)
      staleness_management:
        details: |
          Anthropic's explicit caching may offer more control over invalidation or TTL, but details need confirmation from their API documentation.
          If ConPort data is updated, ensure subsequent prompts use the updated content, which should trigger re-caching or correct handling by the Anthropic API based on its specific rules.
    - provider_name: openai_api
      description: Strategy for OpenAI models with automatic prompt caching.
      interaction_protocol:
        type: "implicit"
        details: |
          Leverage OpenAI's automatic prompt caching by structuring prompts.
          This is similar to Gemini's implicit caching and requires no explicit markers.
          1. Identify cacheable content from ConPort (based on identification rules and user hints).
          2. Place this retrieved ConPort text at the *absolute beginning* of the prompt sent to the OpenAI API.
          3. Append any variable, task-specific parts *after* the stable prefix.
          OpenAI provides a 50% discount on cached input tokens. Caching automatically activates for prompts over a certain length (e.g., >1024 tokens, but verify current documentation).
      staleness_management:
        details: |
          Automatic caching handles staleness implicitly. If prompt prefix changes (e.g., updated ConPort data), OpenAI processes/re-caches new prefix.
